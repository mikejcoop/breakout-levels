# Breakout Levels

A tongue-in-cheek take on the classic Breakout arcade game inspired by the infamous assessment "levels" grid still haunting some schools. Smash through the coloured matrix, earn points for every square you destroy, and clear the board before you run out of lives.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your favourite modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
2. Click **Start** or press the space bar to dive in.
3. Move the paddle with your mouse or the arrow / A & D keys.
4. Break every level block to win before your three lives run out.

## Game Features

- Start, play, and end screens with score summaries.
- Three lives per run with quick resets between attempts.
- Responsive paddle controls (mouse or keyboard).
- Authentic multi-colour level grid inspired by school assessment charts.
- Smooth canvas rendering with subtle lighting and gradients.

Have fun dismantling outdated tracking systems one block at a time!
